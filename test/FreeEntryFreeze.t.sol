/// @notice FS-3 (fullstack audit): the free-entry seat geometry must be a function of state frozen at
///         `freeze = genesis + (day+1)*DAY()`, so that a transfer made AFTER the daily beacon is public
///         cannot reshuffle the draw.
///
///         THE BUG: `_buildSrList` filtered Super Rare membership on LIVE `ownerSince`/`ownerOf`. Because
///         `ownerSince` is re-stamped on every transfer, moving a pass after the freeze dropped it from the
///         list, which changed `srCount`, which changed `wb = srCount*SR_WEIGHT + pledges` AND the dense
///         `srList` index map. Both feed the seat roll (`x % wb`, then `srList[x % srCount]`), so ONE
///         transfer re-rolled EVERY seat. The beacon is public before the draw runs, so a holder of several
///         Super Rares could preview each candidate `srCount`, pick the arrangement that seated their
///         remaining passes best, and execute it.
///
///         THE FIX: membership is decided ONLY by `srRegisteredAt <= freeze` (write-once, freeze-gated, and
///         the scan is a prefix of an append-only array), so `srCount`, `srList` and `wb` are immutable after
///         the freeze. Ownership is tested PER SEAT inside `_pickVirtual`, as a TERMINAL void that burns no
///         rejection budget.
///
///         THE GUARANTEE THESE TESTS PIN, stated exactly as SECURITY.md states it: a post-freeze transfer of
///         a Super Rare can void that pass's own seats and can do nothing else. It cannot move a win to a
///         different pass, cannot change any other seat's occupant, and cannot consume rejection budget.
///
/// @dev    Every test here depends on `MockNFT.transferTo`, which re-stamps `ownerSince` the way the real
///         collection does. `MockNFT.set` deliberately does NOT re-stamp, so using it as a "transfer" would
